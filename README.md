# @everyone
Step #1: Remember to download Unity HUB from here: https://unity.com/download (personal ; free)
Step  #2: AFTER unity hub is downloaded, download the unity editor version  2022.3.62f2  from here: https://unity.com/releases/editor/archive (open the download in the editor when it asks and download on the editor)

**If you already have unity hub, disregard step #1**

Refer to picture:
Download #1  WebGL build support
Download #2 --> if you DO NOT have visual studio code downloaded then click this one too 
(if you have VSC then disregard #2)
